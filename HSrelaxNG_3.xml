<stanza>"I"</stanza>

<li>He disappeared in the dead of winter:</li>
<li>The brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,</li>
<li>And snow disfigured the public statues;</li>
<li>The mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.</li>
<li>What instruments we have agree</li>
<li>The day of his death was a dark cold day.</li>

<li>Far from his illness</li>
<li>The wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,</li>
<li>The peasant river was untempted by the fashionable quays;</li>
<li>By mourning tongues</li>
<li>The death of the poet was kept from his poems.</li>
<li>
But for him it was his last afternoon as himself,</li>
<li>An afternoon of nurses and rumours;</li>
<li>The provinces of his body revolted,</li>
<li>The squares of his mind were empty,</li>
<li>Silence invaded the suburbs,</li>
<li>The current of his feeling failed; he became his admirers.</li>
<li>
Now he is scattered among a hundred cities</li>
<li>And wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,</li>
<li>To find his happiness in another kind of wood</li>
<li>And be punished under a foreign code of conscience.</li>
<li>The words of a dead man</li>
<li>Are modified in the guts of the living.</li>

<li>But in the importance and noise of to-morrow</li>
<li>When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the Bourse,</li>
<li>And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed,</li>
<li>And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom,</li>
<li>A few thousand will think of this day</li>
<li>As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly unusual.</li>

<li>What instruments we have agree</li>
<li>The day of his death was a dark cold day.</li>

<stanza>"II"</stanza>

<li>You were silly like us; your gift survived it all:</li>
<li>The parish of rich women, physical decay,</li>
<li>Yourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.</li>
<li>Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still,</li>
<li>For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives</li>
<li>In the valley of its making where executives</li>
<li>Would never want to tamper, flows on south</li>
<li>From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,</li>
<li>Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,</li>
<li>A way of happening, a mouth.</li>

<stanza>"III"</stanza>

<li>Earth, receive an honoured guest:</li>
<li>William Yeats is laid to rest.</li>
<li>Let the Irish vessel lie</li>
<li>Emptied of its poetry.</li>

<li>In the nightmare of the dark</li>
<li>All the dogs of Europe bark,</li>
<li>And the living nations wait,</li>
<li>Each sequestered in its hate;</li>

<li>Intellectual disgrace</li>
<li>Stares from every human face,</li>
<li>And the seas of pity lie</li>
<li>Locked and frozen in each eye.</li>

<li>Follow, poet, follow right</li>
<li>To the bottom of the night,</li>
<li>With your unconstraining voice</li>
<li>Still persuade us to rejoice;</li>

<li>With the farming of a verse</li>
<li>Make a vineyard of the curse,</li>
<li>Sing of human unsuccess</li>
<li>In a rapture of distress;</li>
<li>
In the deserts of the heart</li>
<li>Let the healing fountain start,</li>
<li>In the prison of his days</li>
<li>Teach the free man how to praise.</li>
